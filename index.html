        <div class="text-apollo"><p>Some years ago a video appeared online claiming to show a secret Apollo mission, 
          Apollo 20, launched in 1976 on a mission to the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>It claims, amongst other things, to show a hidden alien city on the moon, and a female alien held in suspended 
  animation.
Many people believe this to be true, and certainly the maker of the video went to great lengths to make it appear 
that it was genuine.
There are many good debunking videos showing how some of the images have been derived, and I’ll provide links to them later.</p>
<p>There are many good debunking videos showing how some of the images have been derived, and I’ll provide links to
   them later.</p>
<p>What I intend to do here is to debunk the claim that it is filmed inside a genuine command and lunar module, and 
  that the images are from a secret mission. I’m not interested in who did it, or why, I’m interested in how..
The video appears in 3 parts, and I’m going to look at the 2nd part first. Here’s one source for it:</p> </div>

    <p>I’ll start at the very beginning, as it’s a very good place to start, with the opening shot: 
      a shaky view of an Apollo Command Module (CM) hatch window supposedly filmed in space. I will 
      demonstrate two things: firstly, it is a genuine Apollo CM, and secondly it is nowhere near the
       moon but safely on the ground here on Earth.
     Here’s a screenshot of the CM from the film:</p>

       <p>As everyone is looking towards October 21, 2015 - ie, 
         the day Marty McFly travels to in Back to the Future II - they obsess over hoverboards 
         and self-lacing Nikes and Pepsi Perfect. But what they're missing is the bigger message, 
         the deeper meaning, the real truth:</p>
      <p><b>Back to the Future</b> predicted 9/11, and there's a conspiracy video to prove it. </p>
      <p>I don't know how much of this video is for real and how much is a joke, but I will tell you that it really
         blew my mind about 6 minutes in when it juxtaposed Marty from October 2015 (long way around, to be fair) 
         with an image from Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis' new movie, The Walk, released in October 
         2015:</p>
         <p>WHOAAAAAA</p>
         <p>The video is semi-repetitive and a lot of its points are hilariously bizarre - exactly what you might find in a
            conspiracy video. Stuff like the way the 1955 DeLorean burning tire tracks make a 9/11 in the frame, or 
            how the time of Marty meeting Doc at Twin Pines Mall (you can guess what they do with Twin Pines, right?) 
            is 1:16.. 91:1 upside down. There's really good stuff about the Twin Towers on the TV in the future McFly
             household as well. 
            Is it real? Is it parody? 
            This video perfectly proves Poe's Law - you can't tell. And that's what makes it great.</p></div>

       <div class="text-alien">
         <p>Forty years after the government shut it down, the Air Force's infamous UFO organization, Project 
           Blue Book, is in the news again.Last month, a shaky black-and-white video appeared on YouTube that 
           appeared to show a dark interrogation room. On the other side of the table is a hunched, grey alien 
           with bulbous, black eyes. An unseen interrogator starts in with questions:</p>
           <blockquote>Interrogator: We recording? State planet of origin. <br>
              Alien: Earth. <br>
              Interrogator: Yesterday you told us you traveled...and I quote..."Thousands of light years to get here."<br>
              Alien: Yes. <br>
              Interrogator: Tell us the truth or (indiscernible).</blockquote>
        <p>From there, the interrogator asks about time travel, morality, the fate of humanity, the nature of the universe, 
          and the meaning of life. Each question is answered by the alien in a gravelly, guttural voice that sounds more 
          like a garbage compactor than human speech, but each answer is more mind-blowing than the last: the alien claims
           that it's not an alien after all, but a time traveler from a future Earth that has been almost destroyed by 
           nuclear war. It offhandedly mentions that time travel is possible by travelling through space, that this 
           universe is only one of many, and life and death as we know are merely illusions. You can watch the original 
           video here:</p>

         <p>A number of UFO websites and communities picked up the video, generating discussion on whether this was 
           "The One": the final piece of evidence that proved once and for all that extraterrestrials are real. An 
           especially tantalizing piece of information was included in the description of the video:</p>
           <blockquote>
              Extraordinary Project Blue Book file film of Alien interviewed in 1964. Subject was named 'EBE-3' and was held captive for 5 days. 
              Subject disappeared from Government records on date of this event.
           </blockquote>
         <p>Project Blue Book was the official government organization tasked with investigating UFO 
           sightings across the United States. Formally created in 1952, it handled roughly 12,000 sightings 
           of potential UFOs and brought together a team of scientists and military personnel. The project was
            discontinued in 1969, and its records were later declassified. Like MKULTRA or Project Y 
            (the US Air Force's experimental flying saucer, also called the Avrocar), Project Blue Book 
            is one of those secret government projects that seem to confirm every conspiracy theorist's 
            suspicions: the government did have secret task forces investigating extraterrestrials, and 
            its findings were kept secret from the public. What's more, Blue Book was created at a time when 
            UFO sightings had escalated to the point of mass hysteria-Kenneth's Arnold's famed encounter with a 
            V-shaped formation of lights over Mount Rainier became the impetus for Project Blue Book's inception 
            During its operation, Project Blue Book investigated a number of high-profile UFO cases, 
            including the Lubbock Lights. The scientific consultant and astronomer for the Project, J. 
            Allen Hynek, also codified the "Close Encounter" categories-the basis for the title of the sci-fi
             movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Under Captain Edward Ruppelt, the organization coined 
             the term "Unidentified Flying Object" and attempted to create more rigorous reporting methods for
              UFO sightings. As the Project progressed, the majority of sightings were determined to have mundane
               explanations, but a small number were deemed genuinely unexplainable.
            
            However, in the summer of 1952, Project Blue Book was brought before the Robertson Panel, which 
            was meant to assess the Project and its findings. According to a memorandum, the members of the
             Panel were unimpressed with the Project's results and mandated that its primary goal change to 
             creating "an integrated program designed to reassure the public of the total lack of evidence of
              Inimical forces behind the phenomenon." This meant the goal of Project Blue Book had essentially
               changed from seriously investigating extraterrestrials to convincing the public that UFO sightings
                were anything but extraterrestrial.
            
            After changing leadership multiple times and meeting with harsh criticism from outside observers,
             including accusations by NICAP (The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) that the
              group's main goal was covering up UFO encounters, the Project was ultimately shut down, leaving
               behind a legacy of unanswered questions and widespread suspicion.
            
            Like the majority of Project Blue Book's cases, the supposed Blue Book alien interview on 
            YouTube was quickly proven to be fake. It was revealed as a pet project of Aristomenis Tsirbas,
             the digital effects artist behind several Star Trek productions. Isaac Koi, a UFO debunker, wrote 
             up a thorough report on the video and pointed out that Tsirbas had created another UFO hoax video, 
             titled UFO Over Santa Clarita, in 2012, along with a breakdown of how the video was created. You can
              read Isaac Koi's full report <a id="alien-link" href="http://www.isaackoi.com/ufo-videos/koi-ufo-video-127.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
             
            In the face of all these false positives, mysteries,
             and straight-up hoaxes, it's hard to keep faith in reports of extraterrestrials.
              It's enough to make Fox Mulder hang up his badge and gun, but in the end, I think we all want to 
              believe.</p>
